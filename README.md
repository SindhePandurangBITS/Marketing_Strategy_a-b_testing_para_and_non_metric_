## üéØ Business Challenge

The business problem addressed is identifying which marketing contact strategies most effectively drive customer subscriptions. By simulating a real-world A/B test, the analysis compares contacted (treatment) vs. non-contacted (control) users to measure conversion impact. The goal is to determine if outreach works, which methods perform best, and where to focus future marketing efforts.



## What tests included (paarametric and non parametric)?

This project compares marketing strategies using A/B testing. It applies ANOVA, Welch‚Äôs t-test, Tukey‚Äôs HSD, Chi-square, Z-tests, Bayesian tests, Kruskal‚ÄìWallis, Fisher‚Äôs Exact Test  and Mann‚ÄìWhitney U. Visual and diagnostic checks ensure robustness. Insights guide which strategies to scale or drop based on conversion impact.

## Why both parametric and non paara mterictests inlcudded tests?
Both parametric and non-parametric tests are included to ensure reliable results under varying data conditions. When assumptions like normality or equal variance don‚Äôt hold, non-parametric tests provide robust alternatives, ensuring insights remain valid and actionable.

Here‚Äôs your **A/B Testing Project Pipeline** rewritten in a compact, phase-wise format, similar in tone and style to the neural network version:

---

##  A/B Testing Project Pipeline

1. **Business Understanding**
   Define marketing goals: measure strategy impact on subscriptions, identify top performing outreach methods.

2. **Data Wrangling**
   Load and clean campaign logs, define treatment/control groups using `poutcome`, resolve nulls, encode labels.

3. **Preprocessing**
   Binary encode outcomes, format dates, validate group assignments, drop irrelevant or leak prone columns.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   Plot conversion rates, strategy distributions, group sizes, inspect for imbalance or noise.

5. **Diagnostic Tests**
   Assess normality, variance homogeneity, independence, identify assumption violations before selecting test type.

6. **A/B Tests ‚Äì Parametric (Valid)**
   Run Chi-square, Z-tests, Bayesian A/B tests where assumptions (normality, equal variance) are met.

7. **A/B Tests ‚Äì Non-Parametric (No Assumptions)**
   Apply Fisher‚Äôs Exact, Kruskal‚ÄìWallis, Mann‚ÄìWhitney U when assumptions are violated or data is categorical.

8. **A/B Tests ‚Äì Parametric (Partially Valid)**
   Use One-Way ANOVA, Welch‚Äôs t-tests, Tukey HSD relying on large-N robustness (CLT) under partial assumption validity.

9. **Findings & Summary**
   Treatment effect confirmed, strategies differ significantly, Welcome Calls consistently top performer across all tests.

10. **Future Scope**
    Extend to time-based A/B tests, add cost-per-conversion analysis, integrate uplift modeling for causal targeting.
